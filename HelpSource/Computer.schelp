subsection::Project Proposals

You will have to write a strong::project proposal:: per group for your strong::final project::. The proposal will be approximately a page long (A4) and should include a list of group members (full names please) and a brief summary of the project you wish to undertake. It doesn't matter if you slightly change your project later - this is just for me to get an idea of what to expect so that I can advise and support you.
Note::You will need to send me the proposal via email before strong::Friday, 10 February::.::

subsection::Class Presentations

I have decided to postpone the strong::class presentations:: a few days because of the session I had to cancel this week due to illness. Instead of them happening on the 10 and 14 of February, now they will be on the 14 and 17. This will give you a few days extra to prepare. You can see which day you are presenting in the table above.

note::The strong::class presentations:: will now be happening on the strong::14 and 17 of February::::

subsection::Extra Sessions

I will do an extra session on strong::Tuesday, 21 February:: instead of the session that was cancelled this week. In addition, after that date we will have tutorials and troubleshooting sessions.
