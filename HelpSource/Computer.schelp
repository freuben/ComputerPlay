warning::Given that the MRC is undergoing a lift replacement next to my office (including emphasis::BEAUTIFUL:: drilling noises all day...), I've booked the strong::Lyons Studio:: for the tutorials. For those who are not familiar with the strong::Lyons Studio::, it is the studio located in the upper floor of the Music Department main building (SJLCH), past the door, to the left.
