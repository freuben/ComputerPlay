subsection::Assessment Strategy

The assessment criteria specific to this module will be considered and used as a measure to determine your achievement in the assessment process at the end of the module. Seminars will provide the opportunity to gain new knowledge in computer music, programming and creative applications of technology. The workshops will give you practical experience in coding and interactive music technologies and the opportunity to creatively experiment with computers. Practical work will provide the opportunity to demonstrate technical and creative skills and your involvement with technically challenging problems, creative processes and research activities. The written documentation provides you with an opportunity to demonstrate your level of knowledge and understanding of relevant technical and creative concepts, debates and contexts and to present this information clearly.

section::Module Overview

subsection::Module Description

This project examines the creative potential of computers in music and sound. Computers are powerful tools to aid music theory and practice and can be used creatively in composition, performance, sound art, musicology and production. We will look at the fundamentals of computer programming, focusing on creative coding and themes related to computer music and interactivity. However, many of these principles can also be useful in a variety of contexts, applications and technologies and will give you an insight into how new digital technologies are developed.

We will focus on the SuperCollider programming language but also look at other powerful audio/visual, interactive and web development tools. We will explore the creative possibilities of digital technology and the various contexts in which you may want to present your work: live performance, installation, multimedia, video, analysis and interactive applications, etc. We will engage with creativity by approaching these new technologies playfully and with imagination through artistic exploration and experimentation. At the same time, we will interrogate the notion of creativity and consider the idea that computers may also model, simulate and replicate creative processes.

Sessions will introduce the creative and practical implementations of digital signal processing, synthesis, algorithmic composition, audio analysis/resynthesis, interaction, live-electronic performance, graphics, web development, user interfaces, human interface devices, sensors and actuators, live video manipulation, networks, machine listening and learning, and generative music. We will explore the fundamentals of programming with examples in SuperCollider, as well as other computer environments and languages, and will work on a series of focussed tasks to support your learning. Workshop sessions will demonstrate different approaches to creative coding and interaction through hands-on practice.

The project assumes no prior computer programming experience. However, some knowledge of music technology or GCSE Maths / Physics might be beneficial, but not essential.

subsection::Module Outcomes

By the end of the taught part of the project all students should:
list::
##have developed effective approaches to creative coding in their own music or sound practice
##have good familiarity with programming environments for interactive audio applications (SuperCollider) and be able to use them in their own creative and professional practice
##be able to design their own interactive music programs
##demonstrate a good knowledge on topics related to digital audio and computer music as well as human interface devices, algorithmic and generative music, computer analysis, live electronic performance and interaction.
##understand the potential for computers to model, simulate and replicate musical creativity

subsection::Attendance

Attendance to all of the seminars, workshops and tutorials is mandatory. Attendance will be monitored for each of these sessions. You are expected to be on time to all sessions.

subsection::Communication

Please check your university email regularly as this will be the primary form of communication between staff and students. Also, update the module materials in SuperCollider regularly to access lecture slides, supercollider tutorials and exercises, information about deadlines, assessment briefs, reading materials, etc. Before contacting staff members about information, check the module handbook first as most of the module information will be available to you there.

subsection::Independent study

According to university regulations, the amount of time you should devote to private study for a 10-credit module is at least 5 hours per week outside your assessment preparation. Therefore, during this time you should be engaging with the readings, watching films, researching on related topics, experimenting with technology, etc. This of course does not include your time in seminars, workshops and tutorials. In addition to this, you will be expected to spend at least 50 hours for assessment preparation to prepare your presentation and essay. This is the very minimum amount of time of independent study expected from you to pass this module.
